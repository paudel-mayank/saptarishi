                      <p>In the latest episode of the Holistic Health Podcast, Nisarga Eryk Dobosz of the Integral Body
                        Institute, hosts Jennifer McKeever, a somatic therapist, transformational workshop facilitator,
                        and educator</p>
                      <p>The episode tackles such questions as:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Where does the critic come from and why do we even have one?</li>
                        <li>How can we best minimize the pain of the inner critic and move back to self confidence and
                          courage?</li>
                        <li>Why is it so challenging to change our inner critic? What else is needed? Are there any
                          practical exercises that can help bring awareness of the inner critic and shift ourselves to a
                          place of more freedom and self acceptance?</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Jennifer McKeever combines more than 25 years of experience in body-mind therapies, emotional

                        process Path of Love.</p>
                      <p>Her work is about healing the effects of trauma and supporting the journey to wholeness and
                        clarity about who you really are.&nbsp;</p>
